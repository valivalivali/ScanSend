## The Short Version

**We don't collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data.** ScanSend is designed to work entirely on your device. Your documents never leave your iPhone unless you explicitly choose to share them.

## Information We DON'T Collect

ScanSend does NOT collect:
- ❌ Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ Device identifiers
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Usage analytics
- ❌ Crash reports
- ❌ Documents or images you scan
- ❌ Any metadata from your files
- ❌ Browsing history
- ❌ Contact lists
- ❌ Advertising identifiers

## How ScanSend Works

### Local Processing Only
All document scanning, processing, and storage happens exclusively on your iPhone. We have no servers that receive or store your data.

### Camera Access
- **Why we need it**: To scan documents using your iPhone's camera
- **When we access it**: Only when you actively tap the scan button
- **What we do with it**: Convert camera input to document images, stored locally on your device
- **What we DON'T do**: We never transmit camera data anywhere

### Photo Library Access
- **Why we need it**: To save scanned documents and import existing photos
- **When we access it**: Only when you choose to save or import
- **What we do with it**: Read photos you select and save PDFs you create
- **What we DON'T do**: We never access photos without your explicit action

### Document Storage
- **Where documents are stored**: In ScanSend's sandboxed storage on your iPhone
- **Who can access them**: Only you, through the ScanSend app
- **Encryption**: Protected by iOS's built-in encryption
- **Deletion**: When you delete a document, it's permanently removed from your device

## Sharing Your Documents

You control all sharing. When you choose to share a document:
- You explicitly select the sharing method (Email, Messages, AirDrop, etc.)
- The document is sent directly to your chosen destination
- We are not involved in the transmission
- We don't keep copies of shared documents
- We don't track what you share or with whom

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services
- **StoreKit**: For managing Pro subscriptions (handled entirely by Apple)
- **iCloud**: Only if you choose to save documents to iCloud Drive
- **iOS Share Sheet**: For sharing documents (we don't control or track this)

### What We DON'T Use
- ❌ Google Analytics
- ❌ Facebook SDK
- ❌ Advertising networks
- ❌ Crash reporting services
- ❌ Any tracking pixels or beacons

## Subscriptions

ScanSend Pro subscriptions are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store:
- We don't have access to your payment information
- We don't store credit card details
- Apple handles all billing and payment security
- Subscription status is verified through Apple's servers

## Children's Privacy

ScanSend does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13. The app doesn't collect information from anyone, regardless of age. If you're under 13, please use the app with parental guidance.

## Data Security

Your data security is ensured by:
- **On-device processing**: Nothing leaves your phone unless you share it
- **iOS Sandboxing**: Documents are isolated from other apps
- **iOS Encryption**: Your device's passcode protects stored documents
- **No network transmission**: We don't send data to any servers
- **No account system**: No passwords that could be compromised

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: View all your documents in the app
- **Deletion**: Delete any or all documents anytime
- **Portability**: Export your documents as PDFs anytime
- **No consent needed**: We don't collect data, so no consent is required

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of ScanSend after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

Since we don't collect your contact information, we cannot notify you of changes directly. Please check this policy periodically.

## International Users

ScanSend works the same way worldwide:
- No data is transmitted to any country
- All processing stays on your device
- No international data transfers occur

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

California residents have specific privacy rights. However, since ScanSend doesn't collect personal information, the CCPA doesn't apply to our app. We don't:
- Sell personal information
- Collect personal information
- Share personal information with third parties

## European Users (GDPR)

For users in the European Union:
- **Data Controller**: Not applicable (we don't process personal data)
- **Legal Basis**: Not applicable (no data processing)
- **Data Protection Officer**: Not required (no data processing)
